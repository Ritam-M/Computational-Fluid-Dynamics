Double Diffusive Convection Flow Implementation: CL613 Course Project

This Repository contains the Codes, Results for Double Diffusive Convection in a Rectangular Cavity.
We used two methods: SIMPLE, and discretized using Finite Volume Method and Stream Vorticity Approach, and discretized using Finite Difference Method. 
We looked into the plots for different Rayleish numbers.

We discussed 3 variants to the problem:
1. A Triangular Cavity.
2. Conduction from one end.
3. Varying temperature at different walls (A stop-gap Boundary condition).

Our results are in sync with the original paper: A FINITE ELEMENT SOLUTION OF DOUBLE DIFFUSIVE CONVECTION.
For detailed derivations, results and code implemetations go through the Report.
